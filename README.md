# EcologicalSiteSummaries
Summary Reports using AIM & LMF Data
This is a document for R Markdown that knits to HTML a comprehensive summary report of Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) data across ecological sites. This tool requires ecological sites to be pre-identified. 

Follow along this code with the ESS Tool user guide/example (the html report in this repository). 
Download this entire repository and place your copy of the TerrADat geodatabase into the repository folder. 
In the code, specify your ecological site. 
The rest is automated. 

Note, this is a point count report, not a weighted analysis.
