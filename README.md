# EcologicalSiteSummaries
Summary Reports using AIM & LMF Data
This is a document for R Markdown that knits to HTML a comprehensive summary report of Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) data across ecological sites. This tool requires ecological sites to be pre-identified. 

Follow along this code with the ESS Tool user guide. Copy and paste file paths and specify your ecological site. The rest is automated. 

This is a point count report, not a weighted analysis. (The weighted analysis cannot be automated.) 
Contact the NOC or Jornada if you are interested in a weighted analysis (i.e. benchmarked thresholds for % cover of a species across acreage).
